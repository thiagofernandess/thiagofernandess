Hi, I'm Thiago Fernandes, videogame enthusiast, avid reader, noob coder, always a student at The Next Somthing New. Just trying to learn the ropes in what is a very fresh and exciting new area for me. I love teamwork - there just isn't any better way to learn than to find yourself a great partner. Collaboration is key to knowledge, and I try to live by this standard. I'm from Brasil. Ah, secretely, I'm also a nerd.  <div> <img align="right" alt="Thiago-pic" height="350" style="border-radius:170px;" src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1282416/screenshots/2859399/media/77412893f720d98b84e0de1aef75bc17.gif"> </div>
